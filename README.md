# PersonaFlow
An intent-driven, AI-curated information feed. This project filters your information feeds(RSS...) not just by topic, but by quality and perspective, using a dual-system approach: a vector-based recommender learns your interests, while a customizable AI persona acts as a quality "gatekeeper." Built for a single user, with a local-first philosophy.
